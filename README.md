Pixel is a accessibility oriented, fully responsive, modern User Interface Kit that will help you build creative and professional websites. Use our components and sections, switch some Sass variables to build and arrange pages to best suit your needs.

**Over 1k Components**

Buttons, timelines, blog cards, profile cards, tables, accordions... you name it and we have it.

Our components are a perfect extension of Bootstrap 4 so you will find it very easy to work with our code if you're familiar with their class names and styles. Furthermore, we've made sure to that all components are well documented.

Checkout all [all components here](https://demo.themesberg.com/pixel-pro/html/components/all.html).

**50+ Sections**

Sections are made up of components. These are the big boys and they include the navigation bars, footers, about sections, contact sections and many more.

We believe that our navigation bars are one of the most customizable ones out there. You can change the whole color scheme just by changing a letter amongst the classes. Why not check them out under the "Sections" category?

**17 Example Pages**

These are the last building blocks to build an awesome website. We made sure to offer you a few example pages to prove how useful and great our UI Kit is.

**Complete Documentation**

Each component, plugin and the general workflow is well documented. Check out the [online documentation for Pixel Pro](https://themesberg.com/docs/pixel-bootstrap/getting-started/overview/).

## Demo

-   [Live Preview](https://demo.themesberg.com/pixel-pro/)
-   [Product Page](https://themesberg.com/product/ui-kits/pixel-pro-premium-bootstrap-5-ui-kit)

## Quick start

1. Purchase from [Themesberg](https://themesberg.com/product/ui-kits/pixel-pro-premium-bootstrap-5-ui-kit)
2. Download the project's zip
3. Make sure you have Node locally installed.
4. Download Gulp Command Line Interface to be able to use gulp in your Terminal.

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

5. After installing Gulp, run npm install in the main `rocket/` folder to download all the project dependencies. You'll find them in the `node_modules/` folder.

```
npm install
```

6. Run gulp in the `pixel/` folder to serve the project files using BrowserSync. Running gulp will compile the theme and open `/index.html` in your main browser.

```
gulp
```

While the gulp command is running, files in the `assets/scss/`, `assets/js/` and `components/` folders will be monitored for changes. Files from the `assets/scss/` folder will generate injected CSS.

Hit `CTRL+C` to terminate the gulp command. This will stop the local server from running.

## Theme without Sass, Gulp or Npm

If you'd like to get a version of our theme without Sass, Gulp or Npm, we've got you covered. Run the following command:

```
gulp build:dev
```

This will generate a folder `html&css` which will have unminified CSS, Html and Javascript.

## Minified version

If you'd like to compile the code and get a minified version of the HTML and CSS just run the following Gulp command:

```
gulp build:dist
```

This will generate a folder `dist` which will have minified CSS, Html and Javascript.
